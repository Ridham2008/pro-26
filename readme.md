Instructions:
Combine both flours in a bowl and slowly add the water. Stir with a fork and then turn out on a clean surface. Knead dough until it comes together and let rest for 1/2 hour.
Place a gallon of water in a pot on high heat and add 1/4 cup kosher salt. Bring to a boil while you start on step 3.
With a bench scraper or sharp knife cut lengths of the dough and roll into “snakes”. Cut small pieces from each snake (approximately the size of your thumbnail). Press into pieces with your thumb, flip and press your thumb into the other side. Toss orecchiette in semolina to keep from sticking together.
Place a heavy bottomed frying pan over medium heat and add the olive oil and garlic. When garlic starts to brown, add salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and sausage. Stir until the sausage is cooked.
Add broccoli rabe, chickpeas and 4 ounces of the pasta cooking water.
Add the pasta to the pot of boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Drain and add to the frying pan. Add butter and toss for 2 minutes.
Spoon into two bowls and top with grated pecorino.
